Sudo for Android Installer
==========================

This tool installs a simple sudo script to your /system/xbin/.

More information: http://dev.darkrealmgaming.com/projects/mobile/androidsudo/


Download
========

You can download a pre-compiled version directly to your device via the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.darkrealmgaming.androidsudo

Google Play not for you? You can download the pre-compiled APK file from the DRGdl service: http://dl.darkrealmgaming.com/development/android/sudoinstaller/


Source Code
===========

I work on this project in the Eclipse ADT IDE. Import it there. It also requires appcompat-v7 for back compatibility with Android 2.2+


Bugs and Testing
================

Due to the lack of availability of older versions of Android for me to test this on, it may have bugs and issues on older versions of Android (specifically versions lower than 4.0). It may also have universal bugs (with all devices and versions), or bugs with specific devices. If you find a bug, and you have the know-how, fork the project, fix it, then send me a pull request and I will look into fixing it. If you do not have development skills, please use the Issue Tracker to report it and I will look into fixing it. Make sure to mention your device, Android version, ROM (or OEM 'skin') and app version. Thank you! :)
