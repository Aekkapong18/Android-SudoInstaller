Sudo for Android Installer
==========================

This tool installs a simple sudo script to your /system/xbin/.

More information: soon.


Download
========

[Download the latest version from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.darkrealmgaming.androidsudo)

Google Play not for you? [Download the latest APK](https://cdn.coltondrg.com/androidsudo-221.apk)

~~Don't want the latest version? View all versions~~ I've lost all the old versions. Guess you'll just have to use latest (or compile an old one yourself)



~~The current latest version supports Android 4.0+. If you need to use this on Android 2.x, you can download version 2.1.0, which was the last version to support Android 2.2+.~~ I've lost the APK for this version. I will be downloading the old code and recompiling it to recreate it soon. Sorry for any inconvenience.


Source Code
===========

I work on this project in the Eclipse ADT IDE. Import it there. It used to require appcompat-v7, but as of [this commit](https://github.com/ColtonDRG/AndroidSudo/commit/e9047209958b9fa87ffbf06a854a40c055b76d89) this requirement was removed because it no longer supports Android 2.x.


Bugs and Testing
================

It may also have universal bugs (with all devices and versions), or bugs with specific devices. If you find a bug, and you have the know-how, fork the project, fix it, then send me a pull request and I will look into fixing it. If you do not have development skills, please use the Issue Tracker to report it and I will look into fixing it. Make sure to mention your device, Android version, ROM (or OEM 'skin') and app version. Thank you! :)
