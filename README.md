Source Code
===========

I work on this project in the Eclipse ADT IDE. Import it there. It used to require appcompat-v7, but as of [this commit](https://github.com/ColtonDRG/AndroidSudo/commit/e9047209958b9fa87ffbf06a854a40c055b76d89) this requirement was removed because it no longer supports Android 2.x.


Bugs and Testing
================

It may also have universal bugs (with all devices and versions), or bugs with specific devices. If you find a bug, and you have the know-how, fork the project, fix it, then send me a pull request and I will look into fixing it. If you do not have development skills, please use the Issue Tracker to report it and I will look into fixing it. Make sure to mention your device, Android version, ROM (or OEM 'skin') and app version. Thank you! :)
